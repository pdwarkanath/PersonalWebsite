      <description>Last year I built a (very silly) Twitter bot to track the name changes of Nahim (@nah_im_abdulla). I hosted it locally for the best part of the year but decided to move it to the cloud for reliability. If my computer stops working, the bot goes down but that is less likely with AWS.&#xA;Create a Twitter account and app First, I signed up for Twitter using the username NahimName for the bot.</description>

      <description>Are you feeling too happy? Here are some surefire ways to destroy that feeling.&#xA;1. Text your crush Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether they reply immediately, reply late or don&amp;rsquo;t reply at all. It&amp;rsquo;s never what you want. Goodbye happiness. Hello uncertainty, anxiety, insecurity and all those other wonderful feelings.&#xA;2. Take everything personally If someone says &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t like bananas&amp;rdquo; but you like bananas, interpret it as &amp;ldquo;Anyone who likes bananas is stupid&amp;rdquo; and get personally offended.</description>

      <title>What&#39;s In A Name?</title>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s in a name? Apparently a lot if you&amp;rsquo;re applying for jobs.&#xA;Background A few months ago when I was applying for jobs, I found myself scratching my head as to why I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get interviews for positions I was clearly qualified for. While I was networking and meeting people, someone told me it might be my name that recruiters found difficult.&#xA;I can&amp;rsquo;t blame them. Dwarkanath doesn&amp;rsquo;t just roll off the tongue.</description>

      <description>Summary Recently, I worked on a project with Dr. Qian to classify images of skin lesions into the type of skin cancer they exhibited. The data was provided by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) from the HAM10000 dataset. The ISIC Challenge 2018 consisted of 3 tasks. This post is aimed at tackling Task 3 - Disease Classification from images of skin lesions.&#xA;I assume if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, you know what a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is.</description>

      <title>Guide to Eating Out on a budget in Bryan / College Station</title>

      <description>Howdy!&#xA;Those who know me, probably know that I run this small WhatsApp group (approx. 200 members) where I and other members share events or offers for free food on or near campus.&#xA;As poor college students, eating out can be a strain on the budget. At the same time, finding a good deal is a bit of work, usually not worth the effort. So in the last 2 years, I did all the work for you and compiled a list of offers, events and methods to get your grub on without hurting your wallet.</description>

      <title>Atheism</title>

      <description>A common joke goes like this:&#xA;Question: How do you know that someone is an atheist?&#xA;Answer: They&amp;rsquo;ll tell you&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t know where this stereotype comes from but so far I&amp;rsquo;ve been approached by people asking me if I wanted to talk about Jesus but no one has told me they&amp;rsquo;re an atheist. This is classic projection.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m going to stick to the stereotype though and proclaim that I am an atheist.</description>
