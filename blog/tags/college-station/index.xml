      <title>Guide to Eating Out on a budget in Bryan / College Station</title>

      <description>Howdy!
Those who know me, probably know that I run this small WhatsApp group (approx. 200 members) where I and other members share events or offers for free food on or near campus.
As poor college students, eating out can be a strain on the budget. At the same time, finding a good deal is a bit of work, usually not worth the effort. So in the last 2 years, I did all the work for you and compiled a list of offers, events and methods to get your grub on without hurting your wallet.</description>
