      <description>While looking for software engineering jobs, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through a lot of preparation material. Typically, technical interviews will take 3 forms -&#xA;Data Structures and Algorithms System Design Low-level Design / Object-oriented Design The links above have all my notes compiled in one place for each topic.
