      <description>While looking for software engineering jobs, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through a lot of preparation material. Typically, technical interviews will take 3 forms -&#xA;Data Structures and Algorithms System Design Low-level Design / Object-oriented Design The links above have all my notes compiled in one place for each topic. I&amp;rsquo;m using Notion to write these notes.&#xA;A few disclaimers:&#xA;This is not complete and I will keep adding to these as I study more I have added sources wherever possible for readers to read more from Since this is manually written there are bound to be errors.</description>
