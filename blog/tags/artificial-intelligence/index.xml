      <description>Unless you live under a rock you must have heard of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is an umbrella term for any computer program that can perform human-like intelligent tasks (eg. identifying animals) but has come to be interchangeable with Generative AI like ChatGPT.&#xA;Generative AI is, as the name suggests, any tool that &amp;ldquo;generates&amp;rdquo; output like a human would. It could be an essay, an image or code. ChatGPT was not the first Generative AI app but it&amp;rsquo;s selling point was so dead simple it became the most popular very quickly.</description>
